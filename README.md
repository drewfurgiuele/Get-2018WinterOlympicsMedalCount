# Get-2018WinterOlympicsMedalCount

Want a handy PowerShell function to return the 2018 Winter Olympics Medal Counts and current leaders? Look no further. This function uses Invoke-WebRequest to go out and get the medals page from NBC Sports (located here: http://www.nbcolympics.com/medals) and then formats the output in an object.

You can also get static-text output with pretty colors by using the `-Summary` switch.
